#   file: fade.ogg # optional, defaults to "sound name.ogg". place music files in sounds/ directory: supports Vorbis(.ogg) and FMOD Sample Bank(.fsb)
#   duration: 260 # music duration in rounded down seconds
#   world: world # optional. autoplay when the player enters the specific world
#   settings: # optional. client-side settings. this example is default values, default settings can be set in config,yml
